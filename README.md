# BOP-DMD
Code for Bagging, optimized dynamic mode decomposition (BOP-DMD) for robust, stable forecasting with spatial and temporal uncertainty-quantification. The following code if for applications in vortex shedding, sea surface data and toy example.

To run, this code installation of optDMD code from ["Variable projection methods for an optimized dynamic mode decomposition" (Askham et al. 2018)] (https://github.com/duqbo/optdmd) is required

* BOP_DMD_main: main code for toy example (Figure 2, 3)
* BOP_DMD_fluids: main code for vortex shedding example
* BOP_DMD_SST: main code for sea surface temperature data
